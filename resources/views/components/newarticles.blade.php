                        The Kongo-class, IJN Kongo, 1944 (金剛, namesake: Mount Kongō) is a rank V Japanese battleship with a battle rating of 7.0 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update "Wind of Change".
                        The Kongō was the lead ship of the Kongō-class and would be the last Japanese capital ship built outside Japan. Designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston and laid down in 1911 initially as a battlecruiser she would see 2 major refits that would reclassify her as a fast battleship.
                        First commissioned in 1913, patrolling the Chinese coast during WWI, she would see many major naval actions in the Pacific War until November 1944 when she would sink while in transit by a submarine.
